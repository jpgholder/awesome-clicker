# Awesome Clikcer

_This cool clicker is built using [preact](https://preactjs.com/) and [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)_

I've decided to implement as many pretty features as possible that the user will be able to see on the screen depending(or not) on their actions. So I worked on many UX things like responsive design, JS and CSS animations, gradients and probably something else!
