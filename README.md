I've decided to implement as many pretty features as possible that the user will be able to see on the screen depending on their actions. So I worked on many UX things including JS and CSS animations, gradients, 3D particles and more.

## Description

In the default light or dark theme, when the user clicks the _Click_ button, 3D particles are spawned and animated like an explosion in the background. In the special fire theme, activated after 100 consecutive clicks, each click produces a rising fire icon. After a period of inactivity, the fire theme automatically switches back to the light or dark theme. The current click combo is displayed in the progress bar at the bottom. If the user becomes inactive, a timebar appears at the bottom right corner, and when it expires, the current combo is cleared.
